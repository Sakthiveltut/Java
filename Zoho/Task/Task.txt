Array:
1. Write a Java program to find all pairs of elements in an array whose sum is equal to a specified number.

2. Write a Java program to compute the average value of an array of integers except the largest and smallest values.

3. Write a Java program to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence from an unsorted array of integers.
Sample array: [49, 1, 3, 200, 2, 4, 70, 5]
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], therefore the program will return its length 5.
