Features of Java:

1) Java is Simple.
Syntax is derived from C and C++.
pointers,

2) Java is Object Oriented Programming Language Java 8 - Functional Programming - Lambda Expressions
Multiparadigm Programming - JavaScript, Python

Paradigms - Idea
OOP
Functional Programming
Modular Programming
Procedure Oriented Programming

3. Java is Robust:
Robust - powerful.
Error Prone Coding
Compile Time
Run Time
==> Compile Time Error Checking Mechanisms
==> Excellent Memory Management Systems Automatic Garbage Collection
==> Exception Handling

4. Java is Platform Independent:
Platform - Combination of H/w and S/w Processor and OS (Win 7, Linux Mint)
Independent - File Extension --> .mkv, .mp4, .doc
first.java(Programming Language) - Compiler Byte Code (first.class)
--> OS -->
Machine Language (0,1s)

JDK + JRE(JVM) --> Java Developer
JRE --> Java Application User

JDK is Platform Independent.(.java --> .class - Common for all platforms) (Compiler)
JRE(JVM) is platform Dependent. (.class - binary - Specific to each platform)
.class - binary(0,1s) - Conversion - Just In Time(JIT) Compiler
Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA)


5. Java is Secured Language: 
Tamper free coding
Null Interaction with OS

6. Multithreaded Language:
Multithreading is subset of Multitasking
Simultaneous Execution of multiple programs

7. Architecture Neutral:
Compiler --> Byte Code 64 Bit 32 Bit

8. Java is portable.

9.java is high performance language.(two level translation)

JDK --> .java --> .class
.class --> binary

10. Distributed:
Through TCP/IP --> Special Libraries
We can run Java programs in Computer Networks.
