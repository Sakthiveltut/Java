ArrayBlockingQueue:
	Bounded: Unlike an ArrayList or other dynamic arrays, ArrayBlockingQueue has a fixed capacity determined at the time of its creation. 
	Once the queue reaches its capacity, attempts to add more elements will block until space becomes available. 
	This feature helps in scenarios where you want to limit resource usage or prevent memory overflow.
